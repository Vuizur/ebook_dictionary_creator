Add generation of Russian dictionaries

Add this component that automatically generates entries for derived forms that don't have their own entries
(After creating the entire database) For each word, iterate through derived forms:
    if the inflection exists, do nothing
    if it doesn't, check the ending: does it end the same as the base word?
    -> if no, do some extra handling for imperfect form or so
        -> some form of imperfect form detection?
    -> if yes, also check if the accent is captured by the identical ending
        -> if so, the prefix can simply be added to all inflections
        -> else the accented prefix can be added to the unaccented base word inflections
    -> Additionally ся handling
    

Fix that adjectives for Russian are not added to the DB (?)
