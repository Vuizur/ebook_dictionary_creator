Prevent the program from inserting two words that have the same canonical form and part of speech (I think it does so for different etymologies)
Add the forms given by the new Wiktextract dumps (Russian but also maybe for Spanish)

Create public project with name ebookreader_dictionary_creator

Exact prevents uppercase symbols to be matched, so I should evaluate if I should use it

Add a command line interface that executes everything

Fix create_openrussian_database_from_csv so that it doesn't crash from wrong csv data

Fix/report баско́й obsolete

Alternative_canonical_forms is sometimes wrongly filled

Report to Wiktextract that accusative would be nice if it had animate/inanimate tags

Add new inflections from Wiktextract

Refactor create_db_tables_spanish into functions and reuse for english version

Add a custom collation to the Spanish SQLITE file so that it can be searched properly with a nocase version

Delete the openrussian.db database before adding elements again.

Maybe fix the double linkage that occurs when base_form links to a word that is two times in database.
-> But first assure that there are no valid base_form links across part of speech tokens (who knows?)

Recommend dont_append source in pyglossary

Find way to output Dictionary in tabfile

A hurtadillas is currently not recognized -> Change this

Maybe don't add duplicates (unidecoded) to inflections if another form has already been separated
